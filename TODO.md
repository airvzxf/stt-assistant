# STT Assistant - Project Roadmap & ToDo List

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for **STT Assistant**, based on multi-perspective analysis (Users, Developers, DevOps, and SecOps).

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To provide the most private, high-performance, and seamless local Speech-to-Text experience for Linux users, leveraging hardware acceleration (CUDA) while maintaining a lightweight footprint.

## 📋 Strategic ToDo List

### 🛠️ Phase 1: Core & Stability (Developer & DevOps)
*Focus: Refactoring, robustness, and reliability.*
- [ ] **Modernize IPC**: Replace custom text-based protocol with a structured format (JSON-RPC or Varlink) to support metadata (confidence, duration, latency).
- [ ] **Architecture Refactor**: Move core logic from `stt-daemon/src/main.rs` to a `lib.rs` and implement a `Transcriber` trait for future engine support.
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**: Add unit tests for configuration resolution and integration tests for IPC communication.
- [ ] **Hardware Fallback**: Implement automatic CPU fallback if CUDA initialization fails or is unavailable.
- [ ] **Error Management**: Replace generic errors with a structured `Error` enum using `thiserror`.

### 🎨 Phase 2: UX & Accessibility (User & Office)
*Focus: Making the tool accessible to everyone, not just power users.*
- [ ] **Settings GUI**: A GTK4 window to configure language, model selection, and shortcuts without editing TOML files.
- [ ] **Visual Feedback**: Add a VU Meter (audio level indicator) to the OSD while recording.
- [ ] **System Tray/AppIndicator**: A status icon to manage the daemon and quick-access settings.
- [ ] **Smart Dictation**: Implement auto-capitalization and smart punctuation options.
- [ ] **Integrated Model Manager**: A GUI for `stt-model-manager` with download progress bars.

### 🔒 Phase 3: Security & Performance (SecOps & Enthusiast)
*Focus: Hardening and optimization.*
- [ ] **Process Sandboxing**: Use `Landlock` or `seccomp` to restrict the daemon's access to only necessary files/directories.
- [ ] **Integrity Checks**: Add SHA256 checksum verification for model downloads in `stt-model-manager`.
- [ ] **Resource Stats**: Add a `status --verbose` command showing VRAM usage, CPU load, and temperature.
- [ ] **Power Management**: Ensure audio streams are fully suspended when idle to save battery on laptops.

### 🚀 Phase 4: Expansion & Ecosystem (Sponsor & Cloner)
*Focus: Growth and advanced features.*
- [ ] **Flatpak Support**: Investigate packaging via Flatpak with CUDA extensions.
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Allow post-transcription actions (e.g., "Send to GPT", "Auto-Translate", "Log to file").
- [ ] **History Logs**: A local, searchable history of recent transcriptions.
- [ ] **Remote Daemon**: Support for connecting a local client to a powerful GPU server over the network.

## 👥 Persona-Based Suggestions

| Persona | Suggestion |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Non-Technical User** | "Make it a one-click install; I don't want to use the terminal." |
| **DevOps** | "Automate the CUDA architecture detection in CI/CD." |
| **Ciberseguridad** | "Daemon runs as user; ensure socket permissions (0600) are strictly enforced." |
| **Sponsorship** | "Focus on the 'Privacy-First' aspect as a selling point against cloud APIs." |
| **Developer** | "Decouple the GUI from the business logic for easier testing." |

## 💡 User-Type Specific Features

- **Students**: "Lecture Mode" for long-form recordings (30+ mins) saved directly to Markdown.
- **Office Workers**: "Template Filler" for voice-activated form completion.
- **Power Users**: Custom "Initial Prompts" to help Whisper understand technical jargon or specific names.
- **Multilingual Users**: A quick-toggle shortcut to switch between primary and secondary languages.
